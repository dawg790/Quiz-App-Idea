Online Quiz idea

Need to factor in a DB of some kind - maybe utilize Mongo DB for this project

Re-design the layout a bit so it doesn't look so much like the Treehouse quizes
Make it Mobile friendly

Would need a database of users and passwords for login
User could gain scores that would display on a leaderboard or dashboard of types
The scores would be housed in the DB by category or type of quiz
Training department could have access to DB extracts showing scoring leaders?
